# store-it

## About Application

The application was made as a course project of [CS253A](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/Courses/sdo22.shtml/): Software Development and Operations in spring 2022 under the guidance of [Dr. Indranil Saha](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/).

The application, **store-it** aims to be a one-stop solution for the various service providers and stores operators at IITK to catalog their products and services. The residents of IITK can access these online catalogs and place orders directly from the app. Think of it like a platform that digitizes any physical store inside IITK. Broadly, the application will support the following:

- Stakeholders can put a catalog of their products/services.
- Students can add items to their cart and place orders
- Stakeholders can update their inventory and prices.
- Students can get their transaction history, and stakeholders can get their sales history.

**Clients**: IITK Vendors and Campus community

### Project Presentation

The project was presented in front of entire class. [Link to presentation](github-assets//store.it-Presentation-localghosts.pdf)

## Deployment

The web app is deployed at: [store-it-frontend.herokuapp.com](https://store-it-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

_Note:_ This is hosted on Heroku which hibernates upon inactivity on website. It may take upto a minute to load for the first time post inactivity.

## Software Requirement Specification

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It also describes the product's functionality to fulfill all stakeholders (sellers, buyers) needs.

## Software Design Document

A software design document (SDD) describes software created to facilitate analysis, planning, implementation, and decision-making. This explains how a software product or a feature will be built to meet a set of technical requirements. If the requirements document describes the "what" of your project, the design document focuses on the "how".

## Software Implementation Document

A software implementation document (SID) is a document that describes how a software product is built to meet a set of technical requirements. This document talks about implementation details like integration, CI/CD, hosting, VCS; it provides a surface-level overview of codebases and completeness of the application.

## Testing Document

Test documentation includes all files that contain information on the testing team's strategy, progress, metrics, and achieved results. The combination of all available data serves to measure the testing effort, control test coverage, and track future project requirements.
